# personal_dataset
My personal dataset project for Data Analytics
Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?select=heart.csv

Motivation:
The motivation for this project was the thought of being able to predict a heart attack given a couple inputs of data, the question that I wanted to answer was "Does age and chest pain have a good indication of weather or not a person will have heart attack later on?" This may seem like a trivial question but I wanted to be sure, I also checked the correlation of a couple other data entries with the likelihood of a heart attack.

Data Process:
The data cleaning and importing proccess was not all to bad, I found a .csv file off of kaggle that had many many columns of differnt inputs of data, they even provided a heart attack likelihood output which was very helpful in indicating how certain data points would affect a heart attack likelihood. The main cleaning proccess that I did was removing columns that I did not need to be working with and cleaning up some basic things with the .csv file in order to work with them a little more easily.

This graph reprents the ages of three different groups of people that have different levels of chest pain, the colors separate the likelihood of heart attack.
